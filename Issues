1. Null move heuristic and the 50-move rule
   - Possibility of fooling the engine into thinking it could force a draw by null-moving
   - If a line includes a null move, don't increment the half move clock?
2. Stuff to test:
   - Position hashing algorithm
   - 50-move rule
3. Is unmake_move() really required? Can't we just decrement ply?
4. Check SEE algorithm
